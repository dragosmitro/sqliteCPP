# sqliteCPP
A program that simulates SQL lite in C++

Accepted commands are:
CREATE TABLE
DROP TABLE
DISPLAY TABLE
CREATE INDEX
DROP INDEX
INSERT INTO
DELETE FROM
SELECT
UPDATE

This program simulates SQLite in C++. All tables have their unique file that contains the structure of the table & its contents. I also provided a simple test in order to test the program (configtest.txt). This project displays object-oriented-programming at its finest as everything is managed by classes
